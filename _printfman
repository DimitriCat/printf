.SH DESCRIPTION
Functions in the _printf() family produce output into the command line, while converting all
.I format
specifiers into strings. The function _printf() writes output to
.IR "stdout" ,
the standard output stream.
.SH Return Value
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed(excluding the NULL byte at the end of the string).
.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a string of characters. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged into the standard output; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is preceded by the character '%', and ends with a format specifier.
.SS Format Specifier
A character that signifies the type of conversion to be applied. the format specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR d ", " i
The
.I int
argument is converted to decimal notation.
.TP
.B c
The
.I int
argument is converted to and
.IR "unsigned char" ,
and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The
.I char *
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of a character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\\0').
